### Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The workflow involves several key steps:

- **Data Exploration**: Conducted a thorough analysis of the transaction dataset to understand the characteristics of both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. This included generating statistical summaries and creating visualizations to compare transaction amounts and distributions between fraud and normal transactions.

- **Feature Engineering**: Implemented Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance by generating synthetic samples of the minority class. Analyzed feature importance to identify and focus on the most significant predictors of fraud. Selected key features such as `V17`, `V14`, `V12`, and `V10`, which together account for a substantial portion of the predictive power.

- **Modeling**: Developed and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including RandomForestClassifier with SMOTE. Achieved an F2 score of 0.8669, indicating strong performance in balancing precision and recall. Compared results with other models, including Logistic Regression, which showed lower performance. Fine-tuned models using cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization to enhance prediction accuracy.

The goal of this project is to improve the detection of fraudulent transactions, thereby reducing financial losses and enhancing decision-making in financial investments.
